Hello! I’m Mohamad, a passionate and driven web developer with a strong interest in building functional and visually appealing websites.
I enjoy turning ideas into real-world web applications using clean, efficient code. 
With a background in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I’ve developed a solid understanding of front-end development and responsive design principles. 
I’m always eager to learn new technologies and improve my skills, whether it’s exploring modern frameworks like React or enhancing user experience through thoughtful design.
My goal is to grow as a developer while creating projects that make a positive impact.
